    text: `Four years ago, in the middle of a pandemic, we needed a leader with the character to put politics aside and do what was right. Thatâ€™s what 
@JoeBiden
 did.
 
At a time when our economy was reeling, he drove what would become the worldâ€™s strongest recovery â€“ with 17 million new jobs, historic wage gains, and lower health care costs. He passed landmark legislation to rebuild our nationâ€™s infrastructure and address the threat of climate change. 
 
Iâ€™m grateful to Joe for his leadership, his friendship, and his lifetime of service to this country we love.`,
